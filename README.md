Brief Description:
The Smart Pour is a milk dispensing and quality monitoring system working on embedded systems, is an innovative solution designed to revolutionize milk consumption in various settings. This project aims to address two major critical issues related to milk quality assessment and milk dispensing mechanisms by integrating advanced technologies. Also, it solves the major problem of traditional milk testing systems that are time-consuming and lack precision. The project ‘Smart Pour’ consists of a testing and dispensing unit integrated with a Raspberry Pi 4 microcontroller to carry out the processes of milk assessment and dispensing.

In the first phase of the milk processing system, milk is meticulously examined and tested with a cutting-edge ultrasonic milk analyzer at its core. This device evaluates key milk parameters like fat, density, and protein content, complemented by a Raspberry Pi module, pH, and temperature sensors for comprehensive analysis. High-quality milk proceeds for immediate dispensing, while substandard milk is responsibly discarded.

After testing the quality of the milk, there is a dispensing stage where user interaction takes center stage. A user-friendly interface, featuring an LCD screen and keypad, allows customers to select their preferred milk type, whether it's cold or infused with flavors. At the backend, components such as motors, relays, pumps, and mixing blades work together seamlessly to ensure precise and controlled milk dispensing. To prevent any potential overflow, a depth sensor remains vigilant, maintaining a hassle-free milk dispensing experience.
